I believe that managers are here to serve their employees - not the other way around. Accordingly, this meeting is primarily to serve you. I’d love for you to drive it - please send me an agenda of what you’d like to talk about, and we’ll stick to that before discussing other relevant topics.

Ideally, I'd like this to be a safe space for you to:
 - Discuss your happiness, psychological safety, well being, thoughts about team or work environment, etc
 - Discuss career goals & progression
 - Provide feedback to me
 - Bring up things that you wouldn't feel comfortable bringing up in a group setting
 - And anything else you’d like to discuss.

If I have anything to add, I’ll do so after we get through your agenda - as I said, this meeting is primarily for you. 

PLEASE NOTE: This is NOT a status meeting! If you want to give me a status update, do so during standup or grab me as needed - this is a place for higher level discussion about your happiness, growth, etc.

Cheers!
